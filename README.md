# Shockwave.io

A collaboration between 4 students. A multiplayer game hosted on A2Hosting, coded with Node.js/javascript.

The game uses the Socket.io library for TCP sockets. A HTML5 canvas was used, and Node.js handles backend.

Each player controls a bot that sends shockwaves on the ground to hit other players. Each player can move about, jump to dodge shockwaves, and plant walls to block attacks.
Other features:
Holes in the ground one can fall into
Melee combat (jumping on other people)
Shop to upgrade and customize your weapons (phase 2)
